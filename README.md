# PHP Class HttpRequest for the EasyMVC Framework

This is the Class HttpRequest which is used by the EasyMVC framework.  
Can also be used as a standalone plugin for your own code!

## Installation
Install the package using composer.
```
composer require easymvc/httprequest
```

or by editing composer.json yourself and adding:
```
"require": {
    "easymvc/httprequest": "*"
}
```

If you are always using the latest version of PHP, you can use "*" without the need to worry. I'll always try to keep this package up to date with the latest developments in PHP.

However, if you want to make sure you are using the version for your PHP version, use these settings.

For PHP 5.6
```
"require": {
    "easymvc/httprequest": "^5.6"
}
```

For PHP 7.x
```
"require": {
    "easymvc/httprequest": "^7"
}
```

For PHP 8.x
```
"require": {
    "easymvc/httprequest": "^8"
}
```

#### ! The lowest version I support is PHP 5.6 !
